## Getting Started

This project is divided into two main parts: the client-side application (`events-app`) and the server-side application (`backend`). Follow the steps below to set up both environments on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB installed and running on your local machine or accessible remotely

### Setting up the Client (`events-app`)

1. **Navigate to the client directory:**
   ```bash
   cd events-app
npm install
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install react-dom
npm install react-router-dom
npm install axios
npm install bootstrap
npm start
This will run the client-side application on localhost:3000 by default.
Setting up the Server (backend)
cd backend
npm install
npm install cors
npm install body-parser
npm install mongoose
npm start
